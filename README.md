Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my project on the band the Rolling Stones. The projects aim was to show some history of the site and allow fans to enjoy some songs.

Demo

## UX
My goal in the design was to make information accessible on the site, while striving for a minimalist I feel the picture in the background adds a uniqueness of the site

## Features:
This site uses a full width slider, and the site is based on a scroll design 

## Testing:
This site was manually tested to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. My wife also helped out and took the site for a spin. 

## Deployment:
The live site is deployed on GitHub pages. It uses the master branch. It updates each time there is a new push to the repository.

## Credits:
https://codepen.io/JacobLett/full/PjKLgK/ This was used to make the Carousel on the About us page.

## Content:
History of the band and band member Bio's were all taken from Wikipedia

## Bugs:
At first I didn't have the Navbar fixed in place. So I tried making it sticky (Changing  position: sticky;), this caused a line in the background which proved to be very distracting. I changed the position of the container to: Changing  position: fixed; which solved the issue.
I'm still gettingto gribs with CSS, so this site has taken me longer, but with everything,  experience will make it easier and quicker.

## Media:
All photos are from Google Image search  and Audio is from Youtube

## Acknowledgements:

The site is modeled on some exmaple sites I completed, but has been heavly modified.

This is for educational use.
